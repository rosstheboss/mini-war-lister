In addition, because of their loose fighting style, flying units consisting of more than one model have the Skirmishers special rule (see page 77).\n\nMOVING FLYERS\nIn Warhammer, flight is represented by a swoop or glide of up to 10\". The flyer starts off on the ground, takes off, flies to where it wishes to go, and then lands. Flyers, therefore, begin and end their movement on the ground. This is chiefly because it's impractical to suspend models over the battlefield, so we use the 'glide' for the sake of simplicity.\nUnits made up entirely of models that can fly can move or charge normally on the ground, using their Movement value, or instead choose to fly. A unit that flies can move over other units and terrain as it does so, treating the entire move as taking place over open ground. It may not finish the move on top of another unit or in impassable terrain. Depending on the flying model's height and/or position, it will sometimes be able to draw a line of sight over intervening units to a more distant target and make a flying charge over the intervening unit\nA unit that makes a flying charge does so using the glide move of 10\" as its Movement characteristic.\n\nFLYING MARCH\nA unit that is flying can march as normal, doubling its flying move to 20\", representing a particularly long swoop or glide.\n\nFLEE AND PURSUE\nFlyers always move on the ground when attempting to flee or pursue - there simply is no time for them to take off properly. Note that they still benefit from their Swiftstride rule as they flee and pursue.\n\nFLYING CAVALRY\nSome units, such as the noble Bretonnian Pegasus Knights, have the Flying Cavalry special rule - a particularly effective type of flying unit. In rules terms, flying cavalry are treated as Fast Cavalry with the Fly special rule. See page 68 for more details on Fast Cavalry.",

This happens 'for free' at the moment the unit declares\nthe charge or is called upon to make a charge reaction. The unit immediately forms up in base contact around the centremost model in the front rank - if the front rank has an even number of models, and therefore two centremost models, the Skirmishers' controlling player can choose which of the two models the unit will form up around.\nThe number of ranks, files and the formation's facing do not alter as the Skirmishers tighten up - all that happens is that models that were previously spaced out are now in base contact with one another. This has the effect of rendering the\nSkirmishers' loose formation into a regular shape so that other units can fight them in the normal way.\nIf the Skirmishers are not in base contact with an enemy in the Remaining Moves sub-phase, the controlling player must move them apart so that they readopt their loose formation.\n\nFREE REFORM\nA unit of Skirmishers moves, wheels, marches and charges just like other troops.

They can even shoot if they marched or reformed earlier in the turn (providing their weapon doesn't have the Move or Fire special rule). However, the normal -1 To Hit penalty for moving and shooting still applies.\n\nLIGHT TROOPS\nSkirmishers' natural inclination to a sparse formation makes them much less likely to suffer hits from missile fire - all shots aimed at a unit of Skirmishers suffer an additional -1 To Hit penalty. Skirmishers simply lack the necessary mass to push forward onto the enemy and are easily overwhelmed by troops used to fighting in grinding melee.

At the end of every subsequent Magic phase, each magical vortex moves in the direction and distance stated in the spell. If a magical vortex ever ends its move over a unit, place it 1\" beyond the unit in the direction it was moving. Magical vortexes are always remains in play spells (see page 36)."

They only come to an end when the target is slain, or else the caster is slain, chooses to end the spell (which he can do at any time) or leaves the battlefield. The Wizard can continue to cast other spells (but not the same remains in play spell in subsequent turns) as he requires only a little concentration to keep a remains in play spell going.\nIf they are not dispelled immediately when they are cast, remains in play spells can be dispelled at any point during a subsequent Magic phase, using dispel dice as normal, or dice from the power pool as if they were dispel dice if it is your turn.\nRemains in play spells do not retain the energy of their casting, and so a Wizard does not need to beat the original casting dice roll if attempting a dispel in subsequent turns, but rather the minimum casting value listed in the spell's description (so there is no need to make note of each spell's casting roll). For this reason, remains in play spells cast with irresistible force can be dispelled as normal in subsequent turns A Wizard who fails to dispel a remains in play spell during his own or the enemy Magic phase, cannot attempt further dispel or casting attempts for the remainder of the phase."

      "description": "Some magic items, often rings and amulets, and certain troop types, have the ability to use a form of magic called a 'bound spell'. Bound spells can be used even if the bearer has broken his concentration or is not a Wizard at all. Possessing a bound spell does not make a character a Wizard - he just has an item that can cast a spell.\n\nCASTING BOUND SPELLS\nA bound spell is cast just like an ordinary spell - using dice from the power pool (the model may do so even if it is not a Wizard). The required casting value is equal to the bound spell's power level. Note that bound spells never benefit from any casting modifiers that the user might have (for Wizard level, magic items, and so forth). On the other hand, failing to cast a bound spell does not break a wizard's concentration, as using an item that contains a bound spell normally would not require anything more complex than uttering a single word of activation.\nFor example, a High Elf Noble has the Ruby Ring of Ruin, a magic item that contains the lowest level of Fireball as a bound spell. of power level 3. Therefore, when the Noble attempts to cast the spell, the casting roll must be equal to or greater than 3. If the Ruby Ring of Ruin was instead borne by a Level 2 High Elf Mage, he too would need the casting roll to be equal to or greater than 3 - he cannot use his +2 level bonus to boost the score.\nAs in the example above, bound spells are often tied into a spell from a magic lore. Where this is the case and there is a choice of casting levels, the bound spell is always the easier 'unboosted' version with the lower casting level.\n\nDISPELLING BOUND SPELLS \nBound spells are dispelled exactly as other spells - the dispelling Wizard must equal or beat the casting result for a successful dispel.\n\nIRRESISTIBLE FORCE\nA bound spell can be cast with irresistible force, just as a normal spell, by rolling two natural 6s in the casting roll. The bound spell is then cast automatically, and cannot be dispelled (but, of course, causes a miscast).\n\nMiscasts\nWhat happens when a bound spell is miscast depends on the nature of the bound spell.\n• If the bound spell is contained within a magic item of some kind, the item crumbles to dust and cannot be used again during the game. Do not roll on the Miscast table.\n• If the bound spell is an 'innate' ability - such as those used by a Warrior Priest, for example, then the model simply cannot cast further bound spells during this phase. Do not roll on the Miscast table.",

Any model touched by the template must pass an Initiative test or be slain outright with no saves of any kind allowed. If the result on the artillery dice is a misfire, centre the template on the caster and roll a scatter dice and a D6. The template moves the number of inches equal to the result of the D6, in the direction shown on the scatter dice (if you roll a Hit!, use the little arrow shown on the Hit! symbol). In either event, in subsequent turns, the Purple Sun travels in a random direction and moves a number of inches equal to the roll on an artillery dice. If a misfire is rolled in subsequent turns, the Purple Sun collapses in upon itself and is removed. A particularly brave Wizard can infuse the Purple Sun of Xereus with more power, so that it uses the large round template instead. If he does so, the casting value is 25+.",
